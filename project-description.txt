1. Product Overview:
The AI-Based Plant Disease Early Detection System is a web-based prototype application designed to help farmers detect plant diseases early by analyzing leaf images. The system simulates artificial intelligence processing to display disease diagnosis and treatment recommendations interactively.
This product is developed as a UI/UX prototype, not a fully functional AI system.

2. Problem Statement:
- Plant diseases are often detected too late
- Farmers struggle to identify early disease symptoms
- Lack of simple and accessible digital tools
- Manual detection requires experience and time

3. Product Goals:
- Provide a simulation of an AI-based plant disease detection system
- Present a clear and user-friendly application flow
- Demonstrate AI application in sustainable agriculture
- Deliver an interactive prototype for academic purposes

4. Target Users:
- Farmers
- Agriculture / technology students
- Academics
- General users interested in digital agriculture

5. Product Scope:
Included:
- prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Leaf image upload simulation
- AI analysis process simulation (dummy)
- Disease diagnosis results display
- Plant treatment recommendations

Excluded:
- Real Model AI / CNN 
- Backend server
- Database
- IoT Integration

6. User Flow:
- User opens the application
- Views landing page
- Enters homepage
- Selects disease detection feature
- Uploads leaf image
- System processes the image
- User views analysis result
- User views treatment recommendations

7. Functional Requirements:
- System displays a landing page
- System provides page navigation
- Users can upload leaf images
- System shows loading/progress status
- System displays diagnosis results (dummy)
- System shows treatment recommendations

9. Non-Functional Requirements:
- Responsive (mobile-first)
- Easy to understand for non-technical users
- Lightweight and fast loading
- Visual consistency

10. Technology Stack:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Dummy data simulation

11. Success Criteria:
- Prototype runs without errors
- All pages are connected
- System flow is easy to understand
- Features align with the infographic concept

12. Notes:
- This prototype is developed for academic purposes and serves as a simulation, not a real AI implementation.
- The entire prototype must be designed using a mobile-first approach, with the main container limited to smartphone screen size (max-width 390px), single-column layout, vertical scrolling, and touch-friendly buttons. The design should simulate a mobile application even when opened on desktop.
